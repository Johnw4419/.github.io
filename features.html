                        We have two pit areas with numerous aircraft pit stands. We also have a covered shelter near the pits with picnic tables and a second covered shelters for spectators who bring their own chairs. We also have an ADA accessible Port-a-Potty on-site. We do not have potable water on-site, so bring your own drinks. (Don’t forget the Butteville General Store is really close by for drinks and food.) Note that we have a can/bottle recycling program in operation — the drop-off box is between the storage sheds.  Our airfield looking south along the runway. The two light grey taxiways leading off to the right go to the pit areas where pilots can prepare (or repair!) their aircraft. We have ample parking, pit tables, and an ADA accessible Port-A-Potty on site.

                        If you’re new to the hobby and sport of RC aircraft flying and you’d like to get started, or if you have any other questions, please drop us an email using the form on the right. One of our club members will get back to you as soon as they can. (The fields with an * are required.)
                        If you are considering joining our club, please click here for more information on how to do that. If you would like to attend a club meeting look at our calander and show up and introduce yourself.
                        If you would like to fly at our field and not a member, please note that we do require you either to be a guest of a club member who is at the field with you (limit of three times), or to have joined our club before you can fly at our field or receive training.

                        We meet on the third Monday of every month. During May, June, July, August, and September we meet at the Barnstormers Airfield at 7:30 PM (the September meeting happens after our annual Field Clean Up Day and barbecue). The remainder of the year we meet at Willamette Aviation at the Aurora Airport.                </div>

                    <p class="answ">If you’re at our airfield, ask anyone there. If they don’t know the answer, the odds are they will know someone who will. Check out our Contact page though — please email anyone whose name you see there and ask your questions! If you want to get people’s phone numbers and if you are already a member, go to the Members Only page, enter the password and download the current membership list.
